# FASTAPI Project

This repository contains a project built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.

## About the Project

This backend is part of our **final exam project**, which is a **support chatbot** designed to help users with frequently asked questions.  
The backend handles API logic, vector search using Weaviate, and communication with a large language model.

The frontend for this project was developed in collaboration with my teammate and friend **Lasse**. You can find the frontend repository here:

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built on Starlette and Pydantic for speed and efficiency.
- **Automatic Documentation**: Interactive API docs generated with Swagger UI and ReDoc.
- **Asynchronous Support**: Fully supports async programming for modern Python applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/imeugenecarlo/FASTApi.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the FastAPI server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
    - Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
    - ReDoc: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)
